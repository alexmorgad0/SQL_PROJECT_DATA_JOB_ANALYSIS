#  Data Science Job Market Analysis (SQL Project)

## Introduction

This project explores the job market with a focus on **Data Scientist roles**, using structured SQL queries to uncover high-paying positions, in-demand skills, and which skills offer the best salary-to-demand ratio.

> SQL queries are organized in the [project_sql](project_sql) folder.

## Background & Motivation

This project was created as part of my **self-learning journey** in preparation for the **Le Wagon Data Analytics Bootcamp** (starting July 2025). I followed [Luke Barousseâ€™s SQL project course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA).

I previously completed the **Python version of this project**, where I focused on **Data Analyst roles** using the same dataset. Since I had already explored that angle, I decided to shift focus in this SQL project to **Data Scientist jobs** â€” to better understand how the skill requirements and salary dynamics compare across roles in the data space.

This approach also allowed me to:
- Practice SQL in a structured way
- Expand my analysis to more technical and higher-paying job titles
- Build a diverse portfolio project that complements my Python work

## Questions Explored

- What are the top-paying **Data Scientist** jobs?
- What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
- What skills are most in demand for data scientists?
- Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
- What are the **most optimal skills to learn** (based on both salary and demand)?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data science job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data science job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data science positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM    
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
## Here's the breakdown of the top data scientist jobs in 2023:

- **High Earning Potential:** The top 10 data scientist roles offer salaries between **$300,000 and $550,000**, emphasizing the strong compensation available for advanced data roles.

- **Diverse Employers:** High-paying positions are found across a range of industries, with companies like **Selby Jennings, Walmart, Reddit, and Demandbase** leading the way â€” indicating that demand spans across tech, finance, and enterprise sectors.

- **Leadership & Seniority:** Many top-paying roles include titles such as **"Director," "Head of Data Science," and "Distinguished Data Scientist"**, showing that higher salaries are closely linked to seniority and domain specialization.
