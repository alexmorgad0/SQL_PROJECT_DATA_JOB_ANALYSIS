Answer: What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka it’s in high demand and a high-paying skill)?
- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Scientist roles
- Concentrates on remote positions with specified salaries
- Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries), 
    offering strategic insights for career development in data analysis

-- Identifies skills in high demand for Data Scientist roles

-- KEY INSIGHTS

-- 1. Balanced Skills in Demand & Pay:
--    Skills like Snowflake, GCP, and BigQuery stand out for combining high demand (36–72 postings)
--    with salaries above $150K, making them optimal learning targets.

-- 2. Niche Yet Lucrative:
--    Languages like Go and C, though less mainstream for data science, offer top-tier salaries
--    (~$165K), suggesting high value in specialized roles.

-- 3. Foundation Still Matters:
--    Python and SQL continue to show up frequently, confirming their status as must-have core skills 
--    in data science, even if their individual salary averages aren’t at the very top.
