Insights from Top-Paying Data Scientist Skills:

- Niche & emerging tools like Asana, Airtable, Watson, and Elixir are linked to the highest salaries, signaling value in specialized tech.
- AI/ML & cloud skills (e.g., Hugging Face, DynamoDB, BigQuery) show that expertise in modern infrastructure and machine learning frameworks pays well.
- Uncommon languages & frameworks (e.g., Lua, Haskell, Neo4j, RShiny) appear frequently in top-paying roles â€” rarity seems to drive compensation.
